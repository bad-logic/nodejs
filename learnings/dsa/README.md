| Notation | Growth Rate Relationship                    | Relation to CPU cycles                                                                             | Relation to Input Size                                                                  |

| O(n)     | Slower than or equal to n (upper bound)     | CPU cycles will not exceed n. The algorithm can take fewer cycles, but never more than n times.    | The time complexity grows at most as fast as n, or slower for large inputs.             |
| o(n)     | Strictly slower than n (strict upper bound) | CPU cycles grow strictly slower than n, meaning the resource usage will be less than linear.       | As input size n increases, the time complexity grows slower than linear.                |
| Ω(n)     | Faster than or equal to n (lower bound)     | The algorithm will use at least n CPU cycles for large inputs, possibly more, but never fewer.     | The time complexity grows at least as fast as n, but possibly faster.                   |
| ω(n)     | Strictly faster than n (strict lower bound) | CPU cycles grow faster than n, meaning the algorithm takes more than linear time for large inputs. | The time complexity grows strictly faster than n as input size increases.               |
| Θ(n)     | Same as n (tight bound)                     | CPU cycles grow exactly proportional to n, meaning linear time complexity.                         | The time complexity grows exactly at the same rate as n. Doubling n doubles the cycles. |
